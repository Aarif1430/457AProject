===========

Wind farm layout is an optimization problem involving multiple 
parameters such as the number of wind turbines required in the
farm, wind speed, wind direction and location of the turbines.

In this project, we are trying to implement a solution to solve
for the wind farm optimization problem in 5 different approaches:
1 Tabu Search Algorithm(TS)
2 Simulated Annealing(SA)
3 Genetic Algorithm(GA)
4 Partical Swarm Optimization(PSO)
5 Ant Colony Optimization(ACO)
